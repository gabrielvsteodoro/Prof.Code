        <h3>Runaway</h3>
        <p>
            Think I can fly
            Think I can fly when I'm with you
            My arms are wide, catching fire as the wind blows
            I know that I'm rich enough for pride
            I see a billion dollars in your eyes
            Even if we're strangers 'til we die
            
            I wanna run away
            I wanna run away
            Anywhere out this place
            I wanna run away
            Just you and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            Just you and I
            
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I

            I wanna run, chase the morning sun when I'm with you
            Give it all away, catching fire as the wind blows
            I know that I'm rich enough for pride
            I see a billion dollars in your eyes
            Even if we're strangers 'til we die
            
            I wanna run away
            I wanna run away
            Anywhere out this place
            I wanna run away
            Just you and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            Just you and I
            
            You and-
            I, I, I
            Just you and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            You and I, I, I, I, I
            Just you and I
            You and-
            I, I, I
            Oh

        <h3>AroundTheWorld</h3>
        <p>The kisses of the sun were sweet, I didn't blink
            I let it in my eyes like an exotic dream
            The radio playing songs that I have never heard
            I don't know what to say, oh, not another word
            Just la la la la la, it goes around the world
            Just la la la la la, it's all around the world
            Just la la la la la, it goes around the world
            Just la la la la la, it's all around the world
            La la la la la, la la la la la la la

            La la la la la
            And now the night is gone, still it goes on and on
            So deep inside of me, I long to set it free
            I don't know what to do, just can't explain to you
            I don't know what to say, oh, not another word
            Just la la la la la
            (La la la la la, la la la la la la la)
            (La la la la la, la la la la la la la)
            (La la la la la, la la la la la la la)
            It's all around the world
            Just la la la la la, it goes around the world
            Just la la la la la, it's all around the world
            Just la la la la la, it goes around the world
            Just la la la la la, it's all around the world

            (La la la la la)
            (La la la la la)
